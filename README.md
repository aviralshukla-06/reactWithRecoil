# reactWithRecoil

To make our front-end more robust and to manage states more geniunely we have introduced here a popular state management tool 
<b> Recoil</b>
This project demonstrates how to use Recoil for state management in a React application. Recoil is a state management library that provides a clean and scalable way to manage complex state logic in React apps.

📦 Features
🔄 Global state management using Recoil

🧩 Modular React component structure

🔗 React Router integration

🚀 Examples of atoms, selectors, and asynchronous state

🧪 Easily extendable for larger applications

🛠️ Tech Stack
React (Frontend library)

Recoil (State management)

React Router (Routing)

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

🧠 Recoil Concepts Used
Atoms: Basic units of state

Selectors: Derived/computed state

Hooks: useRecoilState, useRecoilValue, useSetRecoilState

📌 Example Use Cases
Toggling dark/light mode using atoms

Synchronized input fields

Derived state using selectors (e.g., filtering lists, calculating values)

Async selectors for API-based state
